## Creating a List with Local Storage

In this project, I worked with JavaScript Type Module, and instead of using a database, the project stores information locally in the browser.

An object is created with a **name, quantity, and an ID** to identify the item that can be deleted later by the user when clicking the close button.

So, in this project i've learned to work with `npm initi` to use ES Modules.
And using `export` and `import` functions to running the code as a modular application.
