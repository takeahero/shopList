## Creating a List with Local Storage

In this project, I worked with JavaScript Type Module, and instead of using a database, the project stores information locally in the browser.

An object is created with a **name, quantity, and an ID** to identify the item that can be deleted later by the user when clicking the close button.

So, in this project i've learned to work with `npm initi` to use ES Modules.
And using `export` and `import` functions to running the code as a modular application.


## Deploy
The project is avaible [here](shop-list-ten.vercel.app).

## How to run locally
Use live view extension if you use VSC.
Or any other server because ES Modules requerid HTTP server to run.
